\section*{Acknowledgement}

The author would like to thank fruitful discussions with Oleg
Viro, Alexander Kirillov, Vladimir Turaev, Shamuel Auyeung, and
Jiahao Hu. The main result of this paper was conjectured by O.
Viro two decades ago; to paraphrase, ``We have two combinatorial
invariants for 4-manifolds. It would be a miracle if they are
different.'' V. Turaev, as a leading expert of this field,
confirmed that it was still open in mid $2021$. Without their
sharing, the author would not have worked on this problem.
