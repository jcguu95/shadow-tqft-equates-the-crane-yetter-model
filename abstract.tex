\abstract{

  It has been open for years to clarify the relationship between
  two smooth $4$-manifolds invariants, the shadow model
  (motivated by statistical mechanics
  \cite{turaev/topology-of-shadows}) and the simplicial
  Crane-Yetter model (motivated by topological quantum field
  theory
  \cite{crane-yetter/a-categorical-construction-of-4d-tqft}),
  both of which degenerate to the $3$D Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev
  model in a special case. Despite the seeming difference in
  their origins and formal constructions, we show that they are
  in fact equal.

  Along the way, we sketch a dictionary between the shadow model
  and the Crane-Yetter model, provide a brief survey to the
  shadow construction a la Turaev, and suggest once again that
  the semisimple models have reached their limits.
