\abstract{

  We prove the equivalence between two invariants of smooth
  $4$-manifolds: the state sums arising from the shadow
  topological quantum field theory and the Crane-Yetter model.

  Along the way, we create a dictionary between the Crane-Yetter
  state sum and the shadow state sum, suggest the community
  moving onto a non-semisimple model, and provide a thin
  introduction to Turaev shadow construction.
